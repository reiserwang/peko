# Frontend Design Skill

Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics.

## Quick Start

Reference this skill when building UI:

```bash
"Build a login page using the frontend-design skill guidelines"
```

## When to Use

- Building web components, pages, or applications
- Creating visually distinctive interfaces
- Need production-grade, memorable designs

## Design Approach

1. **Purpose** - What problem does this solve?
2. **Tone** - Pick a bold aesthetic direction
3. **Constraints** - Technical requirements
4. **Differentiation** - What makes it unforgettable?

## Aesthetic Guidelines

| Element | Guidelines |
|---------|------------|
| **Typography** | Distinctive fonts, avoid Arial/Inter/Roboto |
| **Color** | Cohesive palette, sharp accents |
| **Motion** | High-impact animations, CSS-first |
| **Composition** | Unexpected layouts, asymmetry |
| **Details** | Atmosphere, textures, depth |

## Avoid

- Generic fonts (Inter, Roboto, Arial)
- Purple gradients on white
- Predictable layouts
- Cookie-cutter patterns

## Philosophy

Match implementation complexity to aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code; minimalist needs precision and restraint.
